[b]La Revolution Francaise[/b]

Starting in 1792 right before the French Revolution Wars and ending in 1820 after the Napoleonic Wars, this mod lets you control every country during this period, from France to Russia, from Prussia to the Ottoman Empire.
Decide the fate of the french King: spare him before the the guillotine and expand your french empire, or spread the revolution to every corner of the world and crush the monarchies, its up to you. Or maybee you want to play as the United Kingdom itself and try to stop Napoleon? The future of the world lay in your hands!

[u]LRF is far from complete. [b]Heres whats already finished:[/b][/u]
- [b]MAP:[/b] one of the more complete aspects of the mod, most countries are already included and will just be reworked when I revisit one region again
- [b]FOCUS TREES:[/b] almost nothing is done here. France and Saudi Arabia got a temporary focus tree for now, but far from finished
- [b]TECH:[/b] partly finished, navy. Industry and artillery tech not even included, the rest just as a placeholder
- [b]MILITARY:[/b] the bigger countries like France, Russia or Prussia or some minor ones like Saudi Arabia got an OOB, rest when I work on this region. Navy completely missing
