Aethle: If you haven't seen it, look up the mod "Marching on Your Stomach" and see if maybe there's a way to integrate it into LRF. It's by Axelius and is on the Workshop, He's done some interesting-looking work at creating 'food'and munitions, as well as creating attrition by movement - all key aspects - food and movement-by-attrition especially, that could be key at proper simulating the war. Also, I'd run a couple games as France to see how things go with teh AI, and I'm really not sure yet how, or if, there's a suitable way to force much, much, greater concentrations of forces - with 1-2 province-wide fronts to force the large-scale conflicts that are necessary.
